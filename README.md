Using suitable model from Linear regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest the best model created for Real Estate Housing Price Prediction. The Random Forest model shown the better results than other based on RMSE.

#Main objective:
Goal is to predict the price of the Houses using regression models from the given multible features.

#Plan for data exploration:
cleaning data removing unimportant data dealing with missing (NaN) values if found

#feature engineering
visualizing the data and see the data distribution encoding for categorical variables if found feature scalling for continuous variables

#Spliting the Data & implementing Cross Validation
Train-Test split using k-fold with n=10

#Regression models
Linear regression Decision Tress Regression Random Forest Regression
